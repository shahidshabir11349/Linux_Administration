##################Accessing The Command line#################

Checking the current shell

$ ps -p $$     				displays the current shell
$ echo $ SHELL 


Changing the current shell 

$ vim /etc/shells			lists all available shells 

$ grep shahid /etc/passwd		displays the shell associated with User
	
$ usermod --shell /bin/bash shahid 	modifies shell associated with User by modifying the /etc/passwd file

$ usermod --s /bin/bash shahid

$ chsh --shell /bin/bash shahid		modifies shell associated with User by modifying the /etc/passwd file

$ vim /etc/passwd 			by directly modifying the shell option in the /etc/passwd file using text editor





####################Swithching Between Virtual Consoles/Run Levels####################

how to change runlevels (targets) with systemd. Before we move any further, letâ€™s briefly under the relationship between runlevels numbers and targets.

    Run level 0 is matched by poweroff.target (and runlevel0.target is a symbolic link to poweroff.target).
    Run level 1 is matched by rescue.target (and runlevel1.target is a symbolic link to rescue.target).
    Run level 3 is emulated by multi-user.target (and runlevel3.target is a symbolic link to multi-user.target).
    Run level 5 is emulated by graphical.target (and runlevel5.target is a symbolic link to graphical.target).
    Run level 6 is emulated by reboot.target (and runlevel6.target is a symbolic link to reboot.target).
    Emergency is matched by emergency.target.


$ who -r 		Displays the current run level

$ runlevel		lists the current and previous run level


$ systemctl get-default				Displays the default run level in which system will boot

$ systemctl set-default graphical.target	Sets the default run level to boot

$ systemctl isolate multi-user.target		Changes the run level

$  init 5 					Changes the run level

$ for system which are not using systemd it can be done by editing the file /etc/inittab and  edit this line  id:3:initdefault: just changing the number to desired run level.
						OR
$ To change the default runlevel, use your favorite text editor on /etc/init/rc-sysinit.conf...

$ sudo vim /etc/init/rc-sysinit.conf

Change this line to whichever runlevel you want...

env DEFAULT_RUNLEVEL=2

Then, at each boot, upstart will use that runlevel.



####################Accessing the CLI Through Telnet or SSH####################

$ ssh localhost					Checks weather open ssh server is installed or not

$ apt-get install openssh-client

$ apt-get install openssh-client		installs the OpenSSH client

$ yum install openssh-server			installs the Openssh server

$ systemctl status sshd				displays the status of sshd service status

$ ssh your_username@host_ip_address		command to ssh linus system

$ vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config			edit the configuration file to change the default settings like port no, session limits, listenaddress etc
