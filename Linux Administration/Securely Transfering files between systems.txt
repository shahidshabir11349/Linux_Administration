####################### Securely Transfering Files Between Systems ########################

############ Using scp (secure copy command) ##############

SCP Relies on ssh to operate so ssh should be enabled and user must have permissions in order to copy files.

scp provides a number of options that control every aspect of its behavior. The most widely used options are:

    -P - Specifies the remote host ssh port.
    -p - Preserves files modification and access times.
    -q - Use this option if you want to suppress the progress meter and non-error messages.
    -C - This option forces scp to compresses the data as it is sent to the destination machine.
    -r - This option tells scp to copy directories recursively.


# scp localmachine/path_to_the_file username@server_ip:/path_to_remote_directory    	copies specified file from local machine to Remote machine
# scp -r  VerticalProgramIRMNCH shahid@192.168.10.200:/home/shahid/Desktop/		copies specified directory from local machine to remote machine

# scp -r shahid@192.168.10.200:/home/shahid/Desktop/directorytobecopied	copieddirectoryname	 copies specified directory from remote system to local machine
# scp shahid@192.168.10.200:/home/shahid/Desktop/filetobecopied	copiedfilename	 		copies specified file from remote system to local machine

# scp shahid@192.168.10.200:/home/shahid/Desktop/rufus-3.17.exe  hisdu@172.16.0.10:/home/hisdu/Desktop/		this command copies file or directories from remote machine to another remote machine

# scp -P 2322 file.txt remote_username@10.10.0.2:/remote/directory			if ssh is listening on other port then specifiy port no using -P option

# scp -p  file.txt remote_username@10.10.0.2:/remote/directory				preserves file modification and access time using -p option

################# Using SFTP for windows and linux ####################

The sftp command is an interactive file transfer program with a user interface similar to ftp. However, sftp uses
the SSH File Transfer Protocol to create a secure connection to the server.Not all options available with the ftp command are included in the sftp command, but many of them are.

sftp remote-system-ip				Establishes an sftp connection to a remote system. For instructions, see How to Open and Close an sftp Connection to a Remote System.
sftp remote-system:file				Copies the named file from remote-system.
bye						Quits the sftp session.
help						Lists all sftp commands.
ls						Lists the contents of the remote working directory.
lls						Lists the contents of the local working directory.
pwd						Displays the name of the remote working directory.
cd						Changes the remote working directory.
lcd						Changes the local working directory.
mkdir						Creates a directory on the remote system.
rmdir						Deletes a directory on the remote system.
get						downloads/Copies a file from the remote working directory to the local working directory.
