########### The ps command ############

# ps 		lists processes specific to the terminal
# ps -e 	lists each and every process

# ps -ef	lists every process in full format
# ps -efl	lists every process in full long format

# ps -C sshd	lists all process that match the specified command

# ps -u user1	lists all processes owned by user1

# ps -u group1	lists all processes owned by group1


########### Printing process id of a specific process ##########

# pidof mysqld		prints the process id of specified process

# pgrep mysqld		prints the process id of specified process alongwith parent processes


########### Process Niceness #############
A process is spawned at a certain priority, which is
established at initiation based on a numeric value called
niceness (a.k.a. a nice value). There are 40 niceness values,
with -20 being the highest or the most favorable to the
process, and +19 being the lowest or the least favorable to
the process

# ps -el 			priority (PRI, column 7), which is calculated based on the current niceness value (NI, column 8)	

# nice				prints the default nice value

# sudo nice -n 2 mysqld		renices mentioned process at its startup

# sudo renice -3 5588		renices a running process identified by a process id
 

######### Controlling Processes with Signals ##########
Sometimes it becomes necessary to alert a
process of an event. This is done by sending a control signal
to the process. Processes may use signals to alert each other
as well. The receiving process halts its execution as soon as it
gets the signal and takes an appropriate action as per the
instructions enclosed in the signal. The instructions may
include terminating the process gracefully, killing it abruptly,
or forcing it to re-read its configuration.

# kill -l			lists all possible signals that can be sent to processes
# pkill 744			like kill command
Following are most commonly used signals.

Signal Number		Signal Name		Action
		
1 			SIGHUP 			Hang up signal causes a process to
						disconnect itself from a closed terminal
						that it was tied to. Also used to instruct
						a running daemon to re-read its
						configuration without a restart.
2 			SIGINT 			The ^c (Ctrl+c) signal issued on the
						controlling terminal to interrupt the
						execution of a process.
9 			SIGKILL 		Terminates a process abruptly
15 			SIGTERM 		Sends a soft termination signal to stop
						a process in an orderly fashion. This is
						the default signal if none is specified
						with the command.
18 			SIGCONT 		Same as using the bg command to resume
19 			SIGSTOP 		Same as using Ctrl+z to suspend a job
20 			SIGTSTP 		Same as using the fg command


######################### Top Command Syntax and Options ###########################

# top 				displays all process table with realtime usage
# top -u shahid			displays all the process started by specific usage
# top -p 1760			displays process be process id number

#### Sort Processes
By default, top sorts the process list using the %CPU column. To sort processes using a different column, press one of the following keys:

    M. Sort by the %MEM column.
    N. Sort by PID column.
    T. Sort by the TIME+ column.
    P. Sort by the %CPU column.

#### Change Display Units
Use the E key to choose the units you want top to use for displaying the memory values. 
Press lowercase e to choose the units for displaying values in the process list. The available options are:

    kibibytes (KiB)
    mebibytes (MiB)
    gibibytes (GiB)
    tebibytes (TiB)
    pebibytes (PiB)
    exbibytes (EiB - applies only for memory values)

#### Individual CPU Core Statistics
Pressing 1 on your keyboard allows you to see individual statistics for each CPU core. Press 1 repeatedly to toggle core statistics.
If you want a graphical representation of CPU usage, top supports elementary ASCII graphs, denoting each CPU core usage. Toggle the graphs on or off by pressing t.


#### Memory Usage Graph
The command also supports graphical display options of memory and swap memory lines. To get a visual representation of memory usage, press m. Remove the lines by pressing m again

#### Show Process Command Line
To see the full command line instead of the process name, press the c key. To toggle back to displaying the process name, press c again.

########### Fundamental keystrokes in top

l ,  t ,  m 	Toggles for load, threads, and memory header lines.
1 	Toggle showing individual CPUs or a summary for all CPUs in header.
s   (1) 	Change the refresh (screen) rate, in decimal seconds (e.g., 0.5, 1, 5).
b 	Toggle reverse highlighting for  Running  processes; default is bold only.
B 	Enables use of bold in display, in the header, and for  Running  processes.
H 	Toggle threads; show process summary or individual threads.
u ,  U 	Filter for any user name (effective, real).
M 	Sorts process listing by memory usage, in descending order.
P 	Sorts process listing by processor utilization, in descending order.
k   (1) 	Kill a process. When prompted, enter  PID , then  signal .
r   (1) 	Renice a process. When prompted, enter  PID , then  nice_value .
W 	Write (save) the current display configuration for use at the next  top  restart.
q 	Quit.
