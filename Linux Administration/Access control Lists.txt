########### Access Control Lists ############
The Access Control Lists (ACLs) provide an extended set of
permissions that can be applied on files and directories. These
permissions are in addition to the standard ugo/rwx permissions
and the setuid, setgid, and sticky bit settings. The ACLs define
permissions for named users and named groups using either
octal or symbolic representation of permission allocation. The
named users may or may not be part of the same group. ACLs
are configured and treated the same way on both files and
directories

*** Access Acl are set on individual files and directories,
*** Default Acl can only be applied at the directory level with files and subdirectories inheriting them automatically.
		the directory to be applied the default ACLs needs to have the execute bit set at the public level.


##############The setfacl command is used to apply, modify, or remove ACL
settings. The format for supplying ACL permissions with the
command is explained as under

u[ser]:UID:perms 	Permissions assigned to a named user (username
			or UID). The named user must exist in the
			/etc/passwd file. If this field is left blank, the
			permission will be applied to the owner of the file
			or directory, which is equivalent to using the
			chmod command.

g[roup]:GID:perms	 Permissions assigned to a named group (group
			name or GID). The named group must exist in the
			/etc/group file. If this field is left blank, the
			permission will be applied to the owning group of
			the file or directory, which is equivalent to using
			the chmod command

o[ther]:perms 		Permissions assigned to users that are neither the
			owner nor part of the owning group

m[ask]:perms 		Maximum permissions for a named user or a
			named group. If this is set to rw-, for example,
			then no named user or group will have
			permissions beyond read and write.

######The setfacl command provides a multitude of switches to use
Switch Description
-b 	Removes all access ACLs
-d 	Applies to default ACLs
-k 	Removes all default ACLs
-m	Sets or modifies ACLs
-n 	Prevents an automatic recalculation of the mask
-R 	Applies recursively to a directory
-x 	Removes an access ACL


######The inheritance works

slightly different for files and subdirectories, as indicated below:
• Files receive the shared directory’s default ACLs as their
access ACLs
• Subdirectories receive both default ACLs and access ACLs
as they are





######## Practice Commands

# setfacl -m u:honey:rwx archive1.tar		sets the rwx permission to user honey which is not owner or not in owning group

# setfacl -x u:honey: archive1.tar		removes the acl for user honey from specified file

# getfacl /archive1.tar				prints the acl list applied to specified file of directory
