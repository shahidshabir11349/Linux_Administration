############################## Reset Root Password in CentOS ###################################

####### https://phoenixnap.com/kb/how-to-change-root-password-linux

This is a similar process as in Ubuntu, with a couple of variations.
Step 1: Access Boot Menu

Restart the system, then tap the Esc key about once per second to launch the GRUB menu.
Step 2: Edit Boot Options

Use the arrows to highlight the version of Linux you boot into, then press e to edit.

Use the arrows to highlight the line that starts with kernel or Linux.

Press E to edit

At the end of the line, add a space then type single. Press Enter, then boot into single-user mode by pressing Ctrl-X or B. (The system will display the command to use.)
Step 3: Remount the Drive

You should have a command line, and you’ll have root privileges. To enable read/write access on your hard drive, type the following:

mount / -o remount,rw

Step 4: Changing the Password

Type the following:

passwd

Press Enter, and the system should prompt you to enter and confirm a new password.
Step 5: Restart

Type the following, pressing enter after each line:

mount / -o remount,ro
sync
reboot

Your system should restart. Confirm that your new password works by logging in.

############################### Reset Ubuntu password from recovery mode ##############################

####### Step 1: Boot into recovery mode

Switch the computer on. Go to the grub menu. Generally, it appears automatically – if not, then hold down
the shift key or press Esc key until the boot menu appears.If you’re using Oracle VirtualBox or VMware, 
you have to hold down the shift key when the logo of Oracle or VMware appears.

in the grub menu, select the “Advanced Options for Ubuntu”:

In here, you’ll see the option to go to recovery mode:

It will bring you to a black screen with several lines of output being displayed in a flash. Wait for a few seconds here.


##### Step 2: Drop to root shell prompt

Now you’ll be presented with different options for recovery mode. Here you need to choose “Root – Drop to root shell prompt“.  
Just press the enter key to select this option. Like in the picture below:

You’ll see that when you select the root shell prompt option, an option to enter commands appears at the bottom. This is your
 root shell prompt and this is where you’ll use the commands to reset the password.

##### Step 3: Remount the root with write access

You need to have write access to the root partition. By default, it has read-only access.

Use the command below to remount it with write access:

# mount -rw -o remount /

##### Step 4: Reset username or password

Here, you’ll be given root access. Use the following command to list all the users available:

# ls /home

Based on this command, choose the “username” for which you want to reset or (say) hack the password. 
Now, use the following command to reset the password for the selected “username“:

# passwd username

It prompts for a new password. Enter the new password twice. Do note that when you start typing the password,
nothing is displayed on the screen. This is perfectly normal and actually a security feature in Linux systems. Just blindly type the password and press enter.

# Enter new UNIX password:

# Retype new UNIX password:

You have just successfully reset the password. Now exit the root shell prompt:

exit

When you exit, you’ll be back at the recovery mode menu. Select the normal boot option here.

############################### Reset RedHat Root password ##############################


######### Step-1: Reboot the system and, on the GRUB 2 boot screen, press the e key to interrupt the boot process.

The kernel boot parameters appear look like

load_video
set gfx_payload=keep
insmod gzio
linux ($root)/vmlinuz-4.18.0-80.e18.x86_64 root=/dev/mapper/rhel-root ro crash\
kernel=auto resume=/dev/mapper/rhel-swap rd.lvm.lv/swap rhgb quiet
initrd ($root)/initramfs-4.18.0-80.e18.x86_64.img $tuned_initrd

######### Step-2: Go to the end of the line that starts with linux looks like

linux ($root)/vmlinuz-4.18.0-80.e18.x86_64 root=/dev/mapper/rhel-root ro crash\
kernel=auto resume=/dev/mapper/rhel-swap rd.lvm.lv/swap rhgb quiet

######### Step-3: Press Ctrl+e to jump to the end of the line and Add rd.break to the end of the line that starts with linux like

linux ($root)/vmlinuz-4.18.0-80.e18.x86_64 root=/dev/mapper/rhel-root ro crash\
kernel=auto resume=/dev/mapper/rhel-swap rd.lvm.lv/swap rhgb quiet rd.break

######### Step-4: Press Ctrl+x to start the system with the changed parameters.

The switch_root prompt appears.
Remount the file system as writable:

# mount -o remount,rw /sysroot

The file system is mounted as read-only in the /sysroot directory. Remounting the file system as writable allows you to change the password.

Enter the chroot environment:

# chroot /sysroot

######### Step-5: The sh-4.4# prompt appears.

Reset the root password by following command

# passwd

Follow the instructions displayed by the command line to finalize the change of the root password.
Enable the SELinux relabeling process on the next system boot:

# touch /.autorelabel

# Exit the chroot environment:

# exit

# Exit the switch_root prompt:

# exit

Wait until the SELinux relabeling process is finished. Note that relabeling a large disk might take a long time.
 The system reboots automatically when the process is complete.
